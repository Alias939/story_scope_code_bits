# story_scope_code_bits


The story scope is a installation that uses fiducial markers to create interactions. The framework for the fiducial markers was not created by me, but I developed some small games in unity using this technology. I worked in a team of six people, as a programmer and designer. Some of the small games I helped develop are showcased in the videos. 

Later we started developing one bigger application than the previous small games. This application is an interactive story, where children create their own characters or choose from templates, and then play however they want, interchanging backgrounds and sound effects. The goal of the game is to have a sandbox for children to play in, without needing any external instructions. For this application I also worked as a programmer, with two other people, while also having an art team of three people creating assets.
